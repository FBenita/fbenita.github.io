I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Engineering Systems and Design Pillar at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. I received my Ph.D. in Optimization from National University of Singapore in 2020 under the supervision of Professors Kim-Chuan Toh, Chao Zhou, and Defeng Sun. Prior to joining SUTD in summer 2022, I held Research Fellow positions in the Department of Mathematics and the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics at the National University of Singapore, hosted by Professor Kim-Chuan Toh. I obtained my B.S. in Information and Computing Science from Nanjing University.

This is my [CV](https://yourcvlink.com). Updated in July 2024

## Current Research Interests

- Algorithm design for large-scale optimization problems in data science
- Convex regression problems
- Signal processing
- Stochastic optimization

## Open Positions

I am looking for:
- PhD applicants with strong backgrounds in optimization, fully-supported by SUTD / AISG / SINGA scholarship.
- Students and visiting scholars with strong interests in the area of optimization, data science, and machine learning.
- Research assistants and research interns with relevant research experience on numerical optimization.

Please contact me via email if you are interested to work with me at SUTD.
